Banks pay interest on term deposits based on the period of deposits and normally pay higher interest for longer term deposits. Banks have full discretion to fix their interest rates on deposits and these rates are varied from time to time depending on market conditions.

Retail bank can quote a higher rate of interest for each individual deposits more than $ 150 000. To incorporate the above functionality, developers has to write some batch process/ job which will run on every 15 days of the calendar month and credit the interest amount to each individuals account.</p>
